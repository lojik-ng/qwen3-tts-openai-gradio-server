You are the light of the world, like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand where it gives light to everyone in the house. I had this interesting experience sometime in the early part of 2001. I was having this discussion with the Holy Spirit, asking, how do we go from 2,000 to 5,000?
