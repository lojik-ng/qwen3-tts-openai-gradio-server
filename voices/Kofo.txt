I remember the exact day my fake life journey began. And guess what I did? I relocated myself to Aja on live radio. I had just finished high school then. No job, no plan, just radio, TV and plenty sleep. So that day I turned into the radio and the topic they were discussing was quite interesting. And sometimes I think I quit this fake life early. I should have, you know, pushed further. But now, it's too late. I have people looking up to me.
